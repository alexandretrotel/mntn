/// - Ensures the backup directory exists.

///
/// # Panics
///
/// Panics if the backup directory cannot be created.
///
/// # Details
///
/// Commands executed for packages include bun, npm, pnpm, yarn, pip, uv, brew (and brew cask), cargo, and go.
/// Any panics from these commands are caught and replaced with empty output, allowing backup to continue.
///
/// # Side Effects
///
/// Prints progress and error messages to stdout and logs them via `log`.
